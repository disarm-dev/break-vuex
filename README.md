## Dev
2 options:

1. `npm run dev` - uses `webpack.config.js`
2. `poi src/main.js` (from `npm i -g poi`) - seems to guess everything...

## Build

3 options:

1. `npm run build` - uses `webpack.config.js`
2. Can run the alternative `rollup` config using `npx rollup -c` to ensure you're using the `node_modules` installed version.
3. `poi build src/main.js` (from `npm i -g poi`) - seems to guess everything...`
